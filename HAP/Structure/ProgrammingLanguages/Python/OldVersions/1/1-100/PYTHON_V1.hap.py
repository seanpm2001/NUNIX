# NUNIX idea: HAP files will have swappable language support via the magic number at the beginning of each file. If someone is a Pythoneer or Pythonista at heart, they can choose Python as their default language for what they want to be written in. Likewise, other languages can be swapped for, such as Java, Kotlin, C, C++, C#, Assembly, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, R, REBOL, Vim Script, Emacs Lisp, LISP, Scheme, Racket, F#, Boo, Vala, Genie, Forth, FORTRAN, ALGOL, Go!, Go, etc. all languages will be supported
