# MASSIVE WARNING

The Internet is a great thing, without a doubt. However, when we have an operating system in someones brain, you should be **incredibly** careful. IoT devices get hacked all the time, it could be deadly if the human brain could get hacked remotely by anyone in the world. 

# DO. NOT. GIVE. THE. HUMAN. BRAIN. INTERNET. ACCESS!

This is crucial to the survival of mankind. Not everything needs to be connected to the Internet. The moment the human brain can be hijacked by a government, we will go so far into 1984 that we will never come out, and it is highly likely to lead to the end of humanity.
