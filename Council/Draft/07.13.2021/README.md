# Council for the addition of neural software contributions

**This is a very early draft and needs vast improvement. This has to be perfect, or it shouldn't be done.**

## Don't

* Add Internet access or any features that can connect to a network of any kind

* Add in beliefs, propaganda, or viewpoints that override existing justifiable beliefs

* Force religion or irreligion into peoples thoughts

* Add racist, anti-semetic, homophobic, sexist, ageist, or other discriminatory beliefs into peoples minds

* Add advertisements or self-promotion into the mind

* Give full access to the machines. Let people still be able to think

* Release unstable updates

* Add any tracking code, or anything invasive of the users privacy

## Applies to

This applies to everyone, including enemies or people/other life forms you don't agree with (other life forms included, as this project will be expanded to other life forms, not just homosapiens and animals on Earth)

## Futurism/Cyberpunk

Note: this project is very futuristic and to most people might not occur in their lifetimes. It has been on my todo list for a while, and it needs lots of time to get right, as a single error can spell the end of the human race. Although this project can do good, it needs lots of work before it is ready, and just before the technology emerges. 

## Providers

The providers of digital neural enhancements must be operated by a functional, non-corrupt, ethical, and good entity, and anything done to any of its users must also be done to the manufacturers/suppliers first, so that any attempts to cause a mass genocide of users will result in the destruction of the entitys members, and thus the entity itself.

## Non-compliance penalty

Non-compliance will result in the worst punishment known to life due to the severity of non-compliance. This includes stage 10 terror for life (the worst type of terror to live with, for life) and possibly execution. (this section may need to be modified)

## Draft info

Some of these lines will need to be modified, I may have put too much emphasis on punishing abusers of the technology, but at the same time, I don't feel like I am doing enough in these guidelines to punish. This isn't just a normal life-or-death scenario, it is a scenario that can lead to genocide and extinction of all the species if abused.
